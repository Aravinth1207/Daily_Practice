I have created a simple home service system by using python.

In this i have given the mysql commands to create the tables which i used in this program.

How it works?
    1)In this there is no option for registering user or provider. so we have to make that in mysql by inserting user details and provider details.
    2)First we have to choose login type i.e user and serviceprovider(user is a login type for requesting services and other option for user while the service provider makes the serviceprovider to accept the services and update the serives)
    3)User have to login with their username and Provider have to login with provider ID
    4)this program is based on the question which i have given below
    
    HOME SERVICES SOLUTION
 
________________________________________
Build an application to request for home services solutions
 
The User should be able to,
 
1.	View the  different types of services in a selected city. (example like housecleaning, appliance repair, plumbers , electricians , carpenters, etc. )
2.	Book for a given service at scheduled time slot & list active bookings.
3.	View the Service Provider details, upon acceptance of a Service Provider.
4.	Track the booking status & cancel his/her booking.
5.	Provide the service review and rating for the Service Provider after service completion.
 
The Service Provider should,
1.	View & Accept customer bookings.
2.	Mark the service as complete after a service.
3.	Provide ratings for the customer.
 
Letâ€™s assume both the service provider & User are already registered with the system
